### Notes

ü•á Agora provides tools to add voice, video and chat streaming in your applications. Wherever you build your apps.

üëç Every Month, Agora gives 10, 000 free minutes of streaming to build and test your applications. Ouuuu!

‚òÅÔ∏è Temp Tokens will expire every 24 hours. To use in production, you can use a token server to generate tokens dynamically.

üçÆ The Agora Client Interface provides the basic functionalities for voice, video call such as joining a track, publishing a track, subscribing to other track.

‚õèÔ∏è The mode property can be set to `live` or `rtc`. It specifies the algorithm optimization that you wish to use.

üóëÔ∏è The codec property: the codec that the property should use.

üëæ The `client.join()` method takes in your apps credentials and returns a UID. It adds the local User to the channel. You can set the last arguments to `null` so it auto generates a UID for you.

ü¶∏ `AgoraRTC.createMicrophonAndCamerTracks()`: This method prompts the user to allow agora/the website access the camera and Microphone.

üé∑ When `client.join(...)` is called, it triggers an event `client.on(user-published callback_func)`. This is how we handle users joining our stream/channel remotely. The callback receives two arguments, `user` & `mediaType`.

## Error

```text
Uncaught (in promise) AgoraRTCException: AgoraRTCError INVALID_OPERATION: Can't publish stream, haven't joined yet!
```

Fix:

```diff
- let UID = client.join(APP_ID, CHANNEL_NAME, APP_TOKEN, null);
+ let UID = await client.join(APP_ID, CHANNEL_NAME, APP_TOKEN, null);
```
